 * 	5.3.26 Guaranteed-Bitrate-UL AVP
	The Guaranteedâ€“Bitrate-UL AVP (AVP code 1026) is of type Unsigned32, and it indicates the guaranteed bitrate in bits
	per second for an uplink service data flow. The bandwidth contains all the overhead coming from the IP-layer and the
	layers above, e.g. IP, UDP, RTP and RTP payload.
	When the Extended-BW-NR feature is supported and the value to be transmitted exceeds 2^32-1, the Extended-GBRUL AVP shall be used; see subclause 4.5.30 and subclause 5.3.137.

 * 	5.3.47 Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP
	The Pre-emption Vulnerability AVP (AVP code 1048) is of type Enumerated. If it is provided within the QoSInformation AVP, the AVP defines whether a service data flow can lose the resources assigned to it in order to admit a
	service data flow with higher priority level. If it is provided within the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP, the AVP defines
	whether the default bearer can lose the resources assigned to it in order to admit a pre-emption capable bearer with a
	higher priority level.
	The following values are defined:

	PRE-EMPTION_VULNERABILITY_ENABLED (0)
 		This value indicates that the resources assigned to the service data flow or bearer can be pre-empted and
		allocated to a service data flow or bearer with a higher priority level. This is the default value applicable if this
		AVP is not supplied.
	PRE-EMPTION_VULNERABILITY_DISABLED (1)
 		This value indicates that the resources assigned to the service data flow or bearer shall not be pre-empted and
		allocated to a service data flow or bearer with a higher priority level.

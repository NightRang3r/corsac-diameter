 * 	5.3.118	Routing-Rule-Report AVP
	The Routing-Rule-Report AVP (AVP code 2835) is of type Grouped, and it is used to report the status of NBIFOM routing rules.
	Routing-Rule-Identifier AVP is a reference for a specific NBIFOM routing rule at the PCRF that cannot be installed or modified due to the operatorâ€™s policy or user subscription.
	Routing-Rule-Failure-Code AVP indicates the reason why the NBIFOM routing rules cannot be successfully installed or modified.
	AVP Format:

	Routing-Rule-Report ::= < AVP Header: 2835 >
						*[ Routing-Rule-Identifier ]
						 [ PCC-Rule-Status ]
						 [ Routing-Rule-Failure-Code ]
						*[ AVP ]

	Multiple instances of Routing-Rule-Report AVPs shall be used in the case it is required to report different Routing-Rule-Failure-Code values for different groups of rules within the same Diameter command.

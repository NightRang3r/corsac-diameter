	8.4.22	IMEI-Change
	The IMEI-Change AVP is of type Unsigned32 and it shall contain a bit mask. The meaning of the bits shall be as defined in table 8.4.22-1:
	Table 8.4.22-1: IMEI-Change

	Bit Name
	Description

	0 IMEI
	This bit, when set, indicates that the IMEI has changed (regardless of whether the IMEI Software Version has changed or not).

	1 IMEISV
	This bit, when set, indicates that only the IMEI Software Version has changed but the IMEI has not changed.

	NOTE 1:	Bits not defined in this table shall be cleared by the sender and discarded by the receiver of the command.

	NOTE 2:	Bits 0 and 1 shall not be set simultaneously.

	When a change of IMEI(SV) is reported, the new IMEI(SV) values may be reported to the SCEF in the Terminal-Information AVP inside the Monitoring-Event-Report AVP (see clauseÂ 8.4.3).

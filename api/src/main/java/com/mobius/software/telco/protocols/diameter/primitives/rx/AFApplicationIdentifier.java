 * 	5.3.5	AF-Application-Identifier AVP
	The AF-Application-identifier AVP (AVP code 504) is of type OctetString, and it contains information that identifies the particular service that the AF service session belongs to. This information may be used by the PCRF to differentiate QoS for different application services.
	For example the AF-Application-Identifier may be used as additional information together with the Media-Type AVP when the QoS class for the bearer authorization at the Gx interface is selected. The AF-Application-Identifier may be used also to complete the QoS authorization with application specific default settings in the PCRF if the AF does not provide full service information.
	The AF-Application-Identifier AVP may also be used to trigger the PCRF to indicate to the PCEF/TDF to perform the application detection based on the operatorâ€™s policy.

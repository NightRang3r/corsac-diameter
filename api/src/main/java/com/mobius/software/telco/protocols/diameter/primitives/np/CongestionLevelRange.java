	5.3.5	Congestion-Level-Range AVP
	The Congestion-Level-Range AVP (AVP code 4003) is of type Unsigned32, and it is used to indicate the list of congestion level(s) bound to a certain congestion level set, between the PCRF and the RCAF. The Congestion-Level-Range AVP shall contain a bit mask. The bit 0 shall be the least significant bit. For example, to get the value of bit 0, a bit mask of 0x0001 should be used. The meaning of the bits shall be as defined below:
	TableÂ 5.3.5.1: Congestion Level Range

	Bit Name
	Description

	0 No congestion
	This bit, when set, indicates that the RCAF shall report the corresponding congestion level set id to the PCRF when there is no congestion for a certain user id and PDN ID.

	1 Congestion level 1
	This bit, when set, indicates that the RCAF shall report the corresponding congestion level set id to the PCRF when congestion level 1 is reached for a certain user id and PDN ID.

	1+n Congestion level 1+n
	This bit, when set, indicates that the RCAF shall report the corresponding congestion level set id to the PCRF when congestion level 1+n is reached for a certain  user id and PDN ID.

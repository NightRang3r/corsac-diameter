	Length: m â‰¤ 17
	IMSI value: Text type:
	A GGSN (or a P-GW) receives IMSI that is encoded according to 3GPP TS 29.060 [24] (or 3GPP TS 29.274 [81]) and
	converts IMSI into the UTF-8 characters, which are encoded as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [40]. There shall be no
	padding characters between the MCC and MNC, and between the MNC and MSIN. If the IMSI is less than 15 digits,
	the padding in the GTP information element shall be removed by the GGSN (or the P-GW) and not encoded in this subattribute.
